> I am kind of inspired by a beautiful blog I read in the morning about tech and that reminds me it’s almost been a year ( two months to go) until I finish my first year in the IT industry. (phew :P ) So ergoes, a jot of things I quickly learnt and few I learned the hard way. These opinions are my own and you don’t have to agree. :)


#### The Good :)

* I grew a lot both as a person and a professional. I probably learnt a lot than I ever did in my four years of college
* I care about code quality and open source more than I ever did.
*  Learnt to “Be the engineer that introduces least number of deliberate tech debts”
*  Started teaching in small communities and mentoring. It gives me a strange satisfaction that lasts days.
* Gathered courage to submit proposals to conferences :P


#### The Realisation........ 

* I quickly realised I hate meetings. Thet are mostly a WASTE of time !!
* I love remote. I probably focus best at home. It might be due to my innate nature of not liking to be around people all the time.
* I also realised I could do more that I am presently with a better work life balance. I am probably wasting 50 % of my day's time      sitting in office from 8:30-4:30.
* Work life balance should NEVER be compromised and can only be achieved by "being rude the polite way"
* I should have spent more time with my family and close friends than I did.

#### The Bad :/

* People in the industry are weird. There’s always an other side.
* Women need to sell themselves better in order to make their space especially when they are less in number. They might suffer pay gap if they   don’t speak up despite being talented.
* The HR is not going to help you.
* Last but not the least, an organisation with **bad**, **toxic** and not so **flexible** culture will beat a good person each time.
