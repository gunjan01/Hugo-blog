> This is a really impromptu blog I didnt' even hope, I would publish. It should not even be coming from someone who's probably just over a year old in the industry. Over the past year, if I have to think, learning to review PR's ( pull requests ) have significantly made me pick up more than I hoped for. Being a software engineer, one can see some beautiful artsy work while mostly reviewing pull requests :P

I think PR reviewing skills are greatly undervalued. If everyone could do it classy, we wouldn't really have so many memes about them :P Therefore, ergoes a jot of points I learned to follow while doing reviews. These are based solely on observing the engineers I am acquainted with or have been working with, who do great reviews.

> Disclaimer: Please free to disregard all of it, if it is not in line with the practices that have always been working for you.

* Start with the good parts. If not, please don’t forget to mention them.
* Flexibility  - Please block or unblock a PR based on urgency.
* Vastness of mind - Don’t review with a specific idea in your head.
* Acknowledegement of other’s fantastic work that you didn’t really think of.
* Simplicity in design - Well, full points for readability and straight forward design.
* Quality of work  - This is an uncompromisable entity if it doesn't meet the decided standards.
* Comments are like **gold** - Your comments can make a person spend unnecessary time trying to fix something that doesn’t even need fixing. Spend them wisely. Also, don’t leave comments just because you have to.
