> Of all the problems of the 21st century, I believe a massive one is an affordable education for the masses.

This problem affects millions for probably a quarter of their life as they try to pay off their debts for the fancy degree worth hundreds of dollars. To me, it never made sense to pay 8000$ for a three-credit course ranging only over three months. I think it's a massive failure on our part how we operate as a society. This makes education a privilege. And, It certainly is for a large part of the population. To me, degrees are just a piece of certification that the so-called person has put in the work that goes into the degree. If you put in the work, you should be awarded the degree. There’s no second-guessing to that. This should be the only criterion that should ideally exist for wanting to pursue *any degree*.

For me, education( even postgrad or a Ph.D.)  is just like food, shelter, and clothing. Yes, as basic as that and  it should fulfill the following:

* It should be affordable. Putting students into massive debts in their mid-20s is the worst idea ever!
* It should be accessible across borders and races. The idea of having university campuses is from the 1800s and the new age education system should scale with the need.
* It should be the latest and go through smart upgrades that don’t involve rebuilding the whole system as the demand changes.
* It should answer the *what’s next* for students
* It should be community-centric.

The covid19 pandemic has brought about a knowledge wave exploring the possibilities of classroom learning and that makes me very happy. I believe it is possible to build a great system that grows into a progressive model. Education should never fall into the category where there’s a need to calculate the ROI. Despite sounding very cliche, I truly believe in the quote, "Education can change your world". I do. And I do hope we see a massive change soon enough :)
