> This blog is quite different from the rest. Not sure whether I would publish something like this again but it's sort of my personal unpublished "Tweetstorm" and a checkpoint having little bit of philosophy, little bit of practicality on the things I have seen around me with a handful of them being personal learnings.

* The art of saying "no" and to say it well is one of the most important thing you have to learn. To be able to do this well, your internal clarity should be solid. And if it's not, that's the best time to take a pause and reflect. In a world of influencers, never lose out on your own clarity. 

* Humility is the greatest jewellery you will ever wear in life. 

* In today's era, where there is no value of words, have integrity and stick to it. Integrity, today is a dying virtue by all means and it has the power to set you apart. Too many of moral shortcomings will bite you off one day.
 
* Move on from things. Easier said than done but that pile of regret is mostly from not moving on from things in a timely manner.

* There is no career ladder anywhere. It's the biggest illusion people strive for. The real career ladder is the one which makes you gain more control of your time. Its' funny how we as humans are made to think what growth is. 

* Stick to one thing and do it well. I had a phase in life where I was attracted to many things at the same thing. Made me realize that without hundred percent channelization it's a wasted effort in every sense. Stick to one thing at a time always. 

* Not everything can be measured in monetary terms. Stop looking at money as something that can containerize just about anything.

* Compounding is applicable everywhere. Not just in stocks.

* You will never find closure on every possible thing in life but these experiences will move you in ways you'd never expect. Appreciate the perspective change.

* You will do yourself more harm by not trusting people than trusting them. Give the damn person a chance. In about a quarter of living, I think I have got more advise on being careful than to have trust and that is funny to me. 

* There is too much advise in the market for just about anything. It is often with "Don't take my word for it" tags. But the advise which is willing to bear the brunt of consequences is the one you should take. 

* I have wasted a lot of my life's time so far by not reading regularly. That's the most harmful thing I have ever done to myself and is probably worse than having an addiction. 

* Risk taking is important. Make sure you have some provision to get out of the pit before you jump in. That is, hedge 

Thanks for reading. Until next time !
