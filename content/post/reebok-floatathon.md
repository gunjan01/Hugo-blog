> The marathon. How an average runner becomes more than average.

I don’t really remember when I started caring about fitness but it was vaguely at the start of this year, I think. I have ( *was* would be more appropriate, perhaps :P) been over confident when it came to gaining weight. ***“Oh! I never really gain weight”*** was something common you would hear from me whilst gobbling calories consciously others might give a second thought to. It did take me sometime to realise that the consistency of my weight was mainly due to my tough lifestyle in college and not the awesome metabolism I thought I had. Six months into my first job, I had already gained almost 5 kilos moving to 57- 58 kgs from 52 kgs ( my ideal weight as I am 5 feet seven inches tall). It wasnt the weight I was concerned about. I actually didn’t mind putting on some. I was mostly feeling bloated and unhealthy. So I had to do something about it without joining a gym. I never would want to go to a gym. I hate doing something out of compulsion. But I like to run. So I gave a 10 km marathon called pinkathon a shot hoping to try it out in order to get an idea of how I actually was. I did better than I expected. I finished it in 74 mins. I realised that running I something I would like to do and should do on a regular basis for keeping healthy. I, now try going on at least a 5 km walk every other day. Yesterday, I ran my second 10 km marathon and finished it in 72 mins. Here’s a picture of the medal as a memory. To more runing and to more marathons ! Most importantly, to being healthy whichever way suits you.
