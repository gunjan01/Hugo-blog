# Lesser waste August

> I am not really a hard core environmentalist but definitely someone who wants to try. It is said, "Motivation gets you started, habits keep you going solid". Lately, the two beautiful bloggers and Youtubers, **Lauren Singer** from [ Trash is for Tossers ](http://trashisfortossers.com/)  and **Sadia Badiei** from [ Pick up Limes ]( https://www.pickuplimes.com/blog )  have inspired me to bring about some good reforms in my current lifestyle. So while I am at it, here's a list of some checkpoints I am already doing and another with what I intend to.

#### Things I am already doing:

* Always carry a basic backpack which will always have water bottle and napkin and other basic stuff to stop unnecessary buying of single use bottles.
* Separation of everyday waste as wet or dry.
* Buy in bulk. Stocking up week long veggies goes a long way in reducing everyday waste.
* Mindful water use
* We have very minimal/mostly neglible food thrown in kitchen waste.

#### Things I intend to start this month:

* Buy vegetables plastic free. Always take resuable bags.
* Reduce the consumption of packaged and processed foods by 50%. More specifically, try eating only twice in a week.
* Audit waste This is gonna be hard but I have come to realise that we can only put in efforts to reduce our waste if at all we understand it. :)
* Try out homemade DIY exercises for making basic products. We all love home made food. Turns out, you can even make basic products chemical free at home. Trash is for tossers' YouTube channel has all the information you will ever need.
* A step ahead in understanding minimalism. ( Well, this will require another blog :P )
* Find out an appropriate NGO or company that recycles clothes and sells second hand clothing.

Well that's pretty much it. I will share my findings and also an update on how well I did and the efforts andammendments I had to make, in another blog next month.

> I sincerely belive, if we start changing our lifestyle bit by bit, we will be able to solve the problem of climate change in time before nature takes matters in her own hands. It's is no longer a **far-off** problem, it's happening **now**.
