This post is about my first high altitude trek in the Himalayas. I chose to do the Buran Ghati trek as it felt high on adventure and was a complete package, from meadows, to boulders, to snowfall you can get to see it all. The pass lies in the snow capped mountains of the Dhauladhar range and Gunas Pass falling in the Lesser Himalayas or the Mahabharata range.

> I actually came to the mountains to think about what to do next and they gave me so much more.

#### This was a trek of a lot of firsts like I had anticipated:

* Carrying a 9.5 kg backpack on tough mountain trails. It was no joke. I have never really pushed myself so much      for anything.
* Fell 6 times to get more sure footed
* Camped on 3 feet of snow ( Yes, literally !)
* Climbed really tough inclinations. Learned ridge walking ( keep pole on the side of the mountain ) and how to use   a trek pole as an asset not liability
* Team >>>> you
* Understood waste segregation and the intensity of climate change.
* Some serious breathing and pranayam exercises by Krishna Sir ( a very experienced and senior trek mate)
* First snowfall at 14500 ft ( Wrong time, wrong place but beautiful ) and also a snowball fight :D
* Learned to set up my own tent and to plan a solo expedition.
* Understood the use and importance of some mountainerring equipment ( gaters and microspikes ). Gaters throw off     snow and microspikes are like chewing gum sticking your feet onto snow. You won't fall at any possible acute        inclination.
* Our trek leader, Ravi Sir was a fantastic trekker and leader who not only guided us through the pass but also       taught us so much more. Stories about consumerism, climate change, waste segregation, siachin soldiers and          partition of India. It was fantastic.
* Fear will make matters worse. Be as energetic and normal as possible.

The trek was roughly through:
  Janglik - Dayara ( beautiful meadows ) - Litham ( campsite admist riverside and mountains) - Chandranahan lake ( Origination point of pabbar nadi ) - Dhunda( Too cold and too much snow ) - Buran pass ( 15000 ft )

We started for the pass at 3:07 am. At 5 am we had already climed about 1000 ft and were hoping to see a beatiful sunsrise. But weather had different plans. It surprisingly started snowing and then a whiteout emerged as a result of the snowfall.The horizon started to disappear from the view. We had to retreat and that was a sad moment for all especially when you have just 500 more feet to climb. Nevertheless, this trek will always be complete for me as I got to see two avalanches, experienced my first snowfall, treked in hailstorm and crazy rain with a great team. Also, I learnt about the kind of flora and fauna found at different altitudes. Remember to never take a dip or bath at comforting altitude as it can hit you with AMS instantly. Like our trek leader says, "Mountains main jo ganda, wo zinda".

Another beautiful initiative I got to be part of was the **Green tails** initative by Indiahikes. We cleaned the mountains picking up trash and plastic wherever we could and almost collected 2 kgs of trash in seven days and segregated it in appropriate bags for further disposal. If this is the situation on a non commercial trek, we can only imaging how worse things have got on popular treks. Whilst trekking, I have realised that even if you cannot play a major role in cleaning trails up, to the very least don't leave your own waste behind. That's literally the least one can do and must do.

#### A trek is not only about the trail but also about who you walk the trail with.

I met some beatiful and like minded people who inspired me in one way or another. Here's a short description about each of them.

* Ravi sir - MS of our team. Calm, composed, observant and brave. Worked with Indian air force in the past. An          environmentalist on a mission.
* Krishna sir - Youngest guy in the group ( 56 ). He taught us age is just a number,literally. This was his eighth    high altitude trek.
* Ishaan - Innocence. Happily told people his BP is 170 out of innocence.
* Aman and Dhwanit - Experience and intelligence.
* Mehul - Assistant trek leader as we would call him :P
* Monish - Such a sport really !
* Divya - My tent mate and the most sophisticated person i know :)

After this trek, I have realised that mountaineering is something I would always enjoy and would continue doing until I can. Until the time I am in the mountains again, adios. Although a personal story, I hope this post inspires people to try something new and care about the environment. You don't have to be a hard core environmentalist but changing small things in everyday chores will go a long way. I will try to do the same.

> In a nutshell, I learnt that it is the mountains that decide whether you will climb them or not, not you. The grace of the Almighty is always going to be there to shine a light in you.
